PROJECT: gradusmedia.org (Frontend - Separate Replit Project)

TASK: Add Unsplash photo attribution to article pages

CONTEXT:
Backend recently switched from DALL-E to Unsplash API for article images. The backend now provides these fields for each article:
- image_url (the Unsplash photo URL)
- image_credit (text: "Photo by {Name} on Unsplash")
- image_credit_url (photographer's Unsplash profile URL)
- image_photographer (photographer name only)

REQUIREMENT (Unsplash API Terms Section 9):
Every photo displayed on the website MUST include attribution with:
1. Photographer name (linked to their Unsplash profile)
2. Text "on Unsplash" (linked to https://unsplash.com)
3. Displayed near/below the image

IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:

1. LOCATE ARTICLE DISPLAY COMPONENT
   Find where articles are rendered on the website:
   - Likely: Article.jsx, ArticlePage.jsx, or similar component
   - Look for where {article.image_url} or article image is displayed

2. ADD ATTRIBUTION BELOW IMAGE
   Add this HTML/JSX structure immediately after the article image:
```jsx
   {article.image_url && article.image_photographer && (
     <div className="image-attribution">
       <p className="attribution-text">
         📷 Photo by{' '}
         <a 
           href={article.image_credit_url || `https://unsplash.com/@${article.image_photographer.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '')}`}
           target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer"
           className="photographer-link"
         >
           {article.image_photographer}
         </a>
         {' '}on{' '}
         <a 
           href="https://unsplash.com"
           target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer"
           className="unsplash-link"
         >
           Unsplash
         </a>
       </p>
     </div>
   )}
```

3. ADD STYLING
   Add CSS to make attribution subtle but visible:
```css
   .image-attribution {
     margin-top: 8px;
     margin-bottom: 16px;
     text-align: center;
   }
   
   .attribution-text {
     font-size: 12px;
     color: #666;
     font-style: italic;
   }
   
   .photographer-link,
   .unsplash-link {
     color: #111;
     text-decoration: none;
     font-weight: 500;
     transition: opacity 0.2s;
   }
   
   .photographer-link:hover,
   .unsplash-link:hover {
     opacity: 0.7;
     text-decoration: underline;
   }
```

4. VERIFY API RESPONSE
   Check if the backend API is returning these fields:
   - Make a test API call to your articles endpoint
   - Confirm response includes: image_photographer, image_credit_url
   - If fields are missing, they may need to be added to the API serializer

5. FALLBACK FOR OLD ARTICLES
   Some articles may not have attribution data (old DALL-E images):
   - Only show attribution if image_photographer exists
   - No attribution = no display (graceful degradation)

TESTING CHECKLIST:
□ Attribution appears below images on article pages
□ Photographer name links to their Unsplash profile (opens new tab)
□ "Unsplash" text links to unsplash.com (opens new tab)
□ Styling is subtle but readable
□ Attribution only shows for Unsplash images (not old DALL-E ones)
□ Mobile responsive (test on small screens)

CRITICAL COMPLIANCE NOTE:
This attribution is MANDATORY per Unsplash API Terms Section 9. Failure to display attribution can result in API access being revoked. Every Unsplash photo must have visible, clickable attribution.

EXAMPLE RESULT:
Below each article image, users should see:
📷 Photo by John Doe on Unsplash
(where "John Doe" and "Unsplash" are clickable links)

Begin implementation.
